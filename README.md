# Variational-Inference
The beginning of my journey of Approximate Bayesian Inference

## Step One: Start the Journey
### Basic Concepts
1. Probabilisity Theory [pdf(high-level)](https://see.stanford.edu/materials/aimlcs229/cs229-prob.pdf) [[pdf(more detailed)]](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf)                         
2. Convex Optimization [[pdf]](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-cvxopt.pdf)

### Books for Reference
1. Bayesian Methods for Hackers: Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference [[pdf]]() [[source code]](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers) [**Note:** Suggest reading through!]         
2. Convex Optimization [[pdf]](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf) [**Note:** A little difficult to read, good for reference concerning convex optmization]
